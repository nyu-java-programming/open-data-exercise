	 * Complete the functions called from here, such that:
	 * 	- when the user presses the `1` key, the code calls the showMay2021MorningCounts method to show the morning counts in May 2021, with blue bubble markers on the map.
	 * 	- when the user presses the `2` key, the code calls the showMay2021EveningCounts method to show the evening counts in May 2021, with blue bubble markers on the map.
	 * 	- when the user presses the `3` key, the code calls the showMay2021EveningMorningCountsDifferencemethod to show the difference between the evening and morning counts in May 2021.  If the evening count is greater, the marker should be a green bubble, otherwise, the marker should be a red bubble.
	 * 	- when the user presses the `4` key, the code calls the showMay2021VersusMay2019Counts method to show the difference between the average of the evening and morning counts in May 2021 and the average of the evening and morning counts in May 2019.  If the counts for 2021 are greater, the marker should be a green bubble, otherwise, the marker should be a red bubble.
	 * 	- when the user presses the `5` key, the code calls the customVisualization1 method to show data of your choosing, visualized with marker types of your choosing.
	 * 	- when the user presses the `6` key, the code calls the customVisualization2 method to show data of your choosing, visualized with marker types of your choosing.
